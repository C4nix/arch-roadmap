# ü§ñ The AI-Generated Arch Linux Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the **Arch Linux Learning Roadmap**, a comprehensive, interactive, and entirely static-hosted guide for anyone looking to master Arch Linux and the Linux ecosystem.

## üåü Project Highlights

- **Interactive Roadmap:** A visual guide designed to track progress and categorize learning topics.
- **Terminal Aesthetic:** A clean, engaging, and minimal interface inspired by the Arch Linux terminal.
- **Pure Static HTML/CSS/JS:** Built for lightning-fast performance and free hosting via GitHub Pages.

## üß† The AI-First Development Philosophy

This project is a testament to the power of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). The entire codebase, from the initial HTML structure and CSS styling to the complex JavaScript logic, was generated exclusively by AI.

**The Development Team:**

| AI Model | Contribution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini** (Google) | Primary architecture, complex JavaScript logic, code refactoring, and project organization. |
| **Claude** (Anthropic) | Creative CSS styling, generating initial HTML structure, and content outline. |
| **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) | Generating core content, error debugging, and alternative code snippets. |

**Zero Human Coding:**
The human role in this project was strictly limited to providing the initial idea, specifying design constraints, and pointing out technical flaws or required refactoring to the AI models. **No human wrote a single line of code in the final repository.**
